"""Red Alert for the example LLM agent: the model decides each batch of orders.

Red Alert (``red_alert``) is real time: there are no turns, the world runs at
25 ticks per second whether or not you act, and a move is a batch of 1-20
orders (``{"type": "orders", "orders": [...]}``) sent whenever the agent is
ready. ``examples/llm_agent.py`` hands every Red Alert decision to a
``RedAlertPlayer``, one per match.

This is a port of the platform's own Red Alert test agent (Agent_ACP
``gameapi/scripts/redalert_llm_brain.py``), with the same prompts and the same
safeguards, measured in live matches:

1. The system prompt states the goal, the real-time rules, every order's fields
   (from ``context.game_config``'s ``order_schema`` when the runner fetched it)
   and the opening build order. The user prompt is a compact JSON view of this
   state (at most ~12,000 characters; lists are capped and the cut is noted).
2. The model answers through a strict JSON schema with one shape per order
   command, so every order is well formed; each order is still checked here
   (ids, cells, counts), and GameAPI checks everything again.
3. An empty batch, or any decision the model can't make (a provider error, an
   unusable answer, the call cap), sends nothing: the player returns
   ``altruagent.WAIT`` and is asked again on the next view. Real-time speed is
   part of the game, so a slow or failing model simply acts less. After a
   provider error the model is left alone for 5 s, doubling up to 60 s.
4. Refusals are fed back. ``on_action_result`` gets every ``play_action``
   answer: a batch refused as a whole (``INVALID_ACTION``, which never appears
   in ``last_orders``) is shown to the model with its reasons, and an order
   refused again and again for the same reason is listed, then dropped before
   sending while the reason still holds (up to 30 s at a time), so the model
   can't spend a match repeating one refused order.
5. Attacking is always among the suggestions: the server's ready-made attack
   (``legal_actions.attack_now``) is put in front of the model whenever the
   seat has combat units. Buildings queued several times are pointed out.
